            Undiscovered brass are a very interesting project, designed to expand the arrangements available to brass ensembles. Taking songs that have never been performed by brass bands or had little attention from brass.

                Many thanks again for the wonderful treatment of our daughter. You certainly provided her with an experience she'll never forget. She couldn't stop talking about it all the way home. She has a constant reminder now of something positive about herself that she can listen to when she needs to

                Well, what a fantastic two hours! I took my daughter (the birthday girl) for a singing experience with her friends. I did not really think it would be that good but I was really impressed with the calibre of the whole time there. All our family are taken aback and said our daughter actually looks like a pop star
